# AI Learning Journey 🚀

Hi! I'm currently exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence and preparing to build my first real project. While I don’t have completed work to show yet, I’ve been diving deep into the fundamentals of machine learning, Python, and real-world AI applications. 

## What's next?
I'm currently learning:
•⁠  ⁠Python for ML
•⁠  ⁠Neural networks 
•⁠  ⁠Prompt engineering and LLM basics

This GitHub will soon hold my first AI projects, and I’m excited to grow from here—especially through the Nas House Residency.
